## Description
A list of wallet addresses, contracts, and behaviors that evidence that at one point in time, somebody with this wallet did something based on what they thought was right or interesting without immediate regard for gain.

## How to help
Feel free to suggest updates to this list along with rationales and [for now] I will merge if they seem reasonable. Eventually a community curated version of this would be better.


## Definitions

### Contracts
List of contracts where anyone who did X interaction with them should be considered. The format of this list is Contract address, action (this should be the exact function that was called by the wallet), and rationale (explanation of why this contract x action should be included).  

| Contract address | Contract name | Action | Rationale |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------ | --------- |
